{"text": "doesn't work for price"}
{"text": "this was not useful at all - i wanted to use the cover letter features and had to pay to get access even to try it out. which is probably a decent business model as the cover letter tool is not ready for market yet and needs plenty of work."}

{"text": "hey!\n\ni should have a lifetime subscription to rezi. i filled out a survey a long time ago with my other email (hii@rafantonio.us) where i was given a lifetime subscription in return for my answers. i have screenshots and emails i'm happy to send to verify this."}

{"text": "none"}
{"text": "good service, but not currently looking. happy to reactivate when i switch back to active job search mode"}
{"text": "rezi was a great start, but didn't work as well as intended. it required significant editing, and focused too much on the job description and not enough on my resume. it also got stuck in word loops, repeating the same phrase over and over again.\nall of this would have been fine, as it was still faster than writing my own, but with access to chatgpt through openai for free, the subscription doesn't make sense anymore. it gets about 90% of the way there on a generic prompt for the job description and no resume inclusion (\"write a cover letter for the following job:\n[job description]\")\n\nin addition, the ability to make simple, quick changes with prompts like \"write that again but in four sentences\" or \"write why i would be interested in this job\" help get customization even better, and has a wider, more agile applicability.\n\ni want to be clear that none of this is a condemnation of your product, which was quite good, and would have served very well if a free alternative hadn't been presented. i wish you luck, and will definitely check back in on the product from time-to-time to see what new features, resume/application specific model, etc. you build in. \n\ni hope the feedback was helpful, and i'm happy to provide more or answer questions if it would be useful to you.\n\ngood luck!"}

{"text": "only needed one resume. all done"}
{"text": "i never used it but forgot to cancel it so got charged for two months, which sucks when you're unemployed. the reason i did not use it is because with my long last name it put my name on two lines on the resume and i was not able to edit it. it really just didn't offer a premium look that i needed. sorry."}

{"text": "this was not what i thought.  also, it is horribly difficult to work with.  i found that it has made this task way too difficult where it shouldnt be. i thought it was going to do more stylistically.  all it has done is make a database of my notes then got in my way when i tried to work with it.  also, these are the same templates i find everywhere, the same set, generally.  but then when i actually purchased, i found that it was missing the skills based format that i needed.  i would appreciate a refund, this has been a stumbling block much more than a help.  also, i thought it was an analysis based on a job description, instead it seems to be an offer of an opinion  stylistically that isnt helpful to me, thank you anyway.  please refund."}

{"text": "i don't really like the layouts and there is only 2 options.....\n\ni ended up exporting the resume to a word document and redesigning it myself which took a lot more time than starting one from scratch in a more desirable format. the only reason i joined was to get different layouts and one is pretty standard and the other looks horrendous. editing the layouts without other software is impossible- not even the basic color changes but also spacing which is extremely important. not worth the money at all unless you plan to go for 50 jobs at once."}
